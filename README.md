# simulating-the-effects-of-imperfections-on-crystalisation
My SHP for my 4th year at the university of edinburgh. 



Lammps code to run simulations:
----------------------------------------------------
polydispersity.py to generate particles with different size. 
write_pair_coeff.py used to set up the pair coeffecients for the lammps equilibriation 


My code for data anylsis:
--------------------------------------------------
psi_six.py is used to calculate the psi 6 value for the crystal 

'micheal' code is for pre and post processesing lammps so it is compatible with micheals psi six code 


results:
---------------------



final report and poster:
